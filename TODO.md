1. Investigate how much the unmarshalling of json data affects us? We do this once/twice/thrice

2. Investigate if the consumers should be specialized to betgames and the other api, or as general as now.

3. Rename requests and responses folder files to not have betgames as a prefix to all calls


4. BUG: refresh token seems to work even with the old token (if new token is requested)
